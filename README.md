# Linear_Regression_Bike_Sharing_Assignment

Your task is to develop a model to predict the demand for shared bikes using the provided independent variables. This model will help the management gain insights into how demand fluctuates with different factors. Based on these insights, they can refine their business strategies to align with customer expectations and optimize demand levels. Additionally, the model will serve as a valuable tool for understanding demand patterns in new markets, aiding in strategic decision-making.

Bike Sharing Assignment
Objective
The aim of this project is to analyze and build a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes.

General Information
A bike-sharing system provides a service where bikes are available for shared use on a short-term basis, either for a fee or free of charge. Most bike-sharing systems allow users to borrow bikes from a "dock," which is a computer-controlled station. Users input their payment information to unlock a bike, which can then be returned to any dock within the same system.

Background
BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, has experienced a significant drop in revenues due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The current market conditions have made it challenging for the company to sustain operations. To recover and boost revenues post-lockdown, the company has decided to implement a data-driven business strategy.

Business Requirements
The company seeks to achieve the following objectives:

Demand Modeling:

Develop a predictive model to estimate the demand for shared bikes using independent variables.
Management Insights:

Analyze how demand varies with different features to help the management make informed decisions.
Adjust business strategies to meet customer expectations and optimize demand.
New Market Analysis:

Use the model to study demand dynamics in new markets for strategic expansion planning.
eBusiness Goal
You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the provided independent variables. The outcomes will:

Help management understand the factors influencing bike demand.
Guide strategy adjustments to match demand levels with supply.
Serve as a tool to analyze and plan for new markets.
Libraries Used
The following libraries were utilized to complete the analysis and modeling tasks:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: For numerical computations and handling arrays.
matplotlib.pyplot: For creating visualizations and plots.
seaborn: For enhanced statistical graphics.
sklearn: For machine learning models and evaluation.
statsmodels: For statistical analysis and model building.
This structured approach ensures the project goals align with BoomBikesâ€™ recovery plan, paving the way for better business performance and informed decision-making.
